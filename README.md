Hi

This is my program that makes your raspberry pi into a games console that run scratch games.
I have tested this on raspian jessie and raspian pixel.
It does NOT run on raspian pixel but it does run on raspian jessie. I think this is because on raspian pixel it runs python 3 instead of python 2
You have to copy and paste the "PIstation" folder into the pi directory.
To add your own games you copy and paste them into the \PIstationtch \Games\Scratch\ folder. Putting games in the python folder will not do anything.
This runs scratch 1.4 games and not scratch 2.0 games.
In the code folder there is a script for running the games.
There is 5 pre-installed games in the games folder. Three of them are the scratch games that come with raspian by default. The other 2 are my games.
Test.sb is the test game used for when I was coding PIstation. Shoot_The_Balls.sb is an original game that I made myself, However that version is the outdated version.
The current version is made in Scratch 2.0 and is available at https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/172416456/#fullscreen
When a button is pressed the game is closed. The button is attached to ground and pin 3.

If I forgot to say something please contact me.

Bye
